# llm-linguistic-fingerprints

This repository contains the dataset and code used in the paper: Identifying the Linguistic Fingerprints of Generative AI: A Comparative Analysis of Gemma-2B and Mistral-7B

The project studies whether different large language models exhibit measurable stylometric signatures.
Using 200 shared prompts, two models (Gemma-2B and Mistral-7B) generated 400 texts, which were then analyzed using a set of computational linguistic features.
